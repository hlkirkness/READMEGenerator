# READMEGenerator

## Description
This application is a simple node run app that generates a README based off the questions it asks you! Simply type "node index.js" and the app will ask you a series of questions such as title, how to install, which license you would like to use, and so on. After answering all the questions, the app will generate a professional README for you.

Side note to whomever is grading this; I did this with my tutor and he was worried because we didn't create a repository ahead of time and wanted me to make sure you guys knew I wasn't cheating. Sorry for the low amount of commits!
